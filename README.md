# Project-2---Offensive and Defensive Security Project
In this project I put to practice our class penetration testing skills.

I performed a Red Team attack into a vulnerable system. The ELK server logged the activity information, which the Blue Team reviewed through Kibana.


Project Objectives
This project will apply the knowledge and use of the following skills and tools:

Penetration testing with kali Linux.
Log and incident analysis with Kibana.
System hardening and configuration.
Reporting, documentation, and communication.
The technical skills of this project were performed in a lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services.

Red Team
Before performing the attack it was essential to setup the backend logs to capture the attack data.



Red Team Instructions

Discover the IP address of the Linux web server.
Locate the hidden directory on the web server.
Brute force the password for the hidden directory using Hydra.
Break the hashed password with the Crack Station website or John the Ripper.
Connect to the server via WebDAV.
Upload a PHP reverse shell payload.
Execute payload to open up a meterpreter session.
Find and capture the flag.
Blue Team
Blue Team Instructions

Using Kibana to analyze logs taken during the Red Team attack. The data will be used to develop ideas for new alerts that can improve monitoring.

Even though I already know what I did to exploit the target, analyzing logs is still valuable. It teaches:

What your attack looks like from a defender's perspective.
How stealthy or detectable your tactics are.
Which kinds of alarms and alerts SOC and Incident Response professionals can use to spot these types of attacks while they occur, rather than after.
Creating Dashboards

Using the Dashboards I added the following reports:

HTTP status codes for the top queries [Packetbeat] ECS
Top 10 HTTP requests [Packetbeat] ECS
Network Traffic Between Hosts [Packetbeat Flows] ECS
Top Hosts Creating Traffic [Packetbeat Flows] ECS
Connections over time [Packetbeat Flows] ECS
HTTP error codes [Packetbeat] ECS
Errors vs successful transactions [Packetbeat] ECS
HTTP Transactions [Packetbeat] ECS
Using the search queries in the Discover screen with packetbeat I was tasked with the following:

Identify the offensive traffic.
Find the request for the hidden directory.
Identify the brute force attack.
Find the WebDAV connection.
Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.
